          <div class="post-content">
            <p>The education system has become a <em>farce</em>. We spit out people from
              universities who wait for employment only to find it in a field
              they did not study.</p>
            <p>And if they do end up finding the employment that fits their field,
              they only use a fraction of what they learned in it. And they become
              unfufilled and plateau all the way to their inevitable death. So...
              hey I'm learning web development.</p>

                And now I have been promoted to regional manager at FINCA! All my hardwork is finally paying off :D.</p>
